<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>I come to this profession with definite beliefs in mind in relation to who I will be as a successful teacher, employee, and member of your community. I am a teacher who most importantly embraces the development of a trusting environment with my students. In my opinion, students only open up to learning beyond the borders of basic requirements when trust is present. One of the skills I will utilize in building the before mentioned environment is found in the ability to communicate efficiently with oneâ€™s students. I will not only provide educational data from the curriculum, but am a good listener willing to respond in kind to all ideas presented by the classroom community. I will also respond well to change in being open to learning from others in trying new approaches in lesson construction and delivery.</p>
